            Hello!  
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Hi, Iâ€™m Jackie â€” a junior full stack developer with a background in education, insurance, and public service. I create thoughtful, scalable web applications with React, Node.js, and a deep love for clean, purposeful code.

          Iâ€™m passionate about tech that uplifts, simplifies, and empowers â€” especially for families, educators, and everyday users. When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m parenting with intention, learning languages, kickboxing, or cooking up something (literally and figuratively).

          I believe in writing software the way I live life: with clarity, kindness, and curiosity. Letâ€™s build something that matters.
          </p>

            Please feel free to check out my portfolio or send me a message if you want to connect. ðŸ˜Š
