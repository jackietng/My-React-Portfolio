            Hello!  
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          My name is Jacqueline Nguyen. I also go by "Jackie." I was a Financial Aid Specialist with over 6 years of experience in reviewing financial aid regulations and data for both university and community college students. I am now a proud stay-at-home mom with a vivacious 1-year-old. My empathy, eargerness to learn, and curiosity allow me to understand and question applications both from the user and technical perspective. In addition to learning coding, I also enjoy exploring new foods and reading in my free time.
